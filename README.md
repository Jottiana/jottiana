## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jottiana/jottiana/main/IMG_2384.jpeg" alt="banner that says Agnes Mathieu - web development student"> 


Iâ€™m currently transitioning to a new career and studying web development. Iâ€™m passionate about coding and constantly expanding my skills. Iâ€™m in a 4-month internship at [Davi](https://davi.ai/) to gain hands-on experience. Letâ€™s connect and collaborate!

  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about advanced JavaScript, React with TypeScript, Tailwind and API integration. Iâ€™m also exploring UX/UI design through Figma and deepening my understanding of Git and Scrum practices.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that promote diversity in tech, especially initiatives aimed at encouraging young girls to explore coding and web development.
  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my journey in web development, the technologies Iâ€™m learning, or my projects aimed at making tech more inclusive.
  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agnes-mathieu-bouchez)
  
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m passionate about creating resources that encourage girls to explore the tech world. My dream project is to build a website that highlights women in tech and shows young girls that they have a place in this field.
   [And...I've started making my dream come true](https://github.com/Jottiana/girl-power-code).
